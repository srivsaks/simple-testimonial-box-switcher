        Heidi Swansonâ€™s 101 Cookbooks focuses on providing healthy everyday
        recipes. It currently features over 700 vegetarian, whole food, vegan,
        and instant pot recipes. Heidi began the blog in 2003 when she looked at
        her vast collection of cookbooks and decided that it was time to stop
        collecting and start cooking. She was sick of repeating the same recipes
        over and over again. She felt it was time to explore the books in her
        collection. As Heidi worked her way through her cookbooks, her skills
        and cooking knowledge improved, and she built her own repertoire of
        successful recipes. Nowadays, Heidi chooses and writes about recipes
        that intersect her life, travels, and everyday interests. Often these
        are from her cookbook collection, but sometimes not.
